# jazz-tools
Command line utility to help analyze and prepare for playing a jazz tune.

Initial implimentation takes in a music xml file and pulls out the chords and some other metadata.  Features in progress:
* Highligh non-diatonic roots
* spot common progressions (2-5-1, tritone substitution, backdoor dominant)
* Use gemini to summarize progressions
